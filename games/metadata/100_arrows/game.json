  "controls": "To play 100 Arrows, click anywhere and stretch your arrow back then let go to shoot. Pay attention to the dots to see the angle of your arrow and the strength to each shot. As a tip, it’s best not click to close to the edge of the game so you have plenty of space to angle and stretch your arrow. You’ll get plenty of chances to pass each level but you’re still limited on arrows. Click on the menu to turn off sound/music or restart the online game.",
