  "controls": "To play this action game, use your mouse or finger to flick the dart onto the board. This online game follows the basic rules of darts: the object is for one player or a team to be the first to reach zero from their starting number. After three darts are thrown, the throwing player subtracts the total scored from his current total until he reaches zero. Pay attention to the numbers on the darts as the higher ones will get you closer to your goal.",
