  "description": "Ace of Spades is an online card game for you to play for some casual fun. The concept of this online game is simple: pick a card that is 1 less or 1 higher than the open card. There is nothing too complicated with this card game. However, donâ€™t think that you will beat it right away. This is a timed game, so you must act quickly and choose each step wisely. There are 10 levels of this online game for you to play! Each level has its own challenge with a different pattern of placement for the cards. Some patterns may be basic rows and others may be circles. Select High Scores to see if your score is up there with other great card players!",

  "controls": "To play this card game, remove all the cards by selecting the free cards that are 1 higher or 1 lower than the open card. You can play either a King or 2 on Ace. If you have no card that can be used for the open card, you can click on the deck for a new card. When you run out of cards to play, you lose the game. Otherwise, if you match all the cards, then you win the level.",
