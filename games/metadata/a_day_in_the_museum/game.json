  "description": "A Day in the Museum is a puzzle game where you have to find the differences between two images. Stroll down this lovely museum and learn about history as you play a hidden object game. These are real-life photographs of rooms showing artifacts in museums. There are dinosaur skeletons, tools, art, vases, and other historic items for you to view as you play this online game. There are some obvious differences but others will not be so easy to find. Pay attention to every little detail. Use as little hints as possible to better your score. Take advantage of the zoom feature to find tiny differences that you may have missed on your first view. Complete all 30 levels with the best score possible that you can. Click on the High Scores tab to see if you landed on the top 200 players for this online game. If you didn’t get the score you wanted, you can always play again!",
